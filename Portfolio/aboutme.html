            I am a public health nurse <br />
            and a registered nurse
          </li>
          <li>
            I have also studied Finnish language <br />and communication

            My studies in Business College Helsinki <br />to become a web
            developer have been brief <br />but <b>intense</b>: they started in
            March 2019 <br />and will finish in December 2019.

            I was a real newbie when I started, but I <br />have learned a ton
            and beyond.

            My skill stack consists of <br />basic knowledge of <br />HTML5
            including CSS and <br />
            JS, PHP and Java, <br />React and Symfony.
          </li>
          <li>
            Currently I am more interested <br />in backend than frontend.
          </li>
          <li>knowledge of CMSs, such as Drupal.</li>
          <li>I use Git (mostly by myself though)</li>
          <li>
            I know windows better than Linux <br />
            but I am working on it.

            I am trustworthy: in my latest job, <br />
            I was assigned with a task of <br />delivering transplants from
            abroad. <br />I also worked as a senior <br />nurse supporting
            colleagues <br />with medical questions.
          </li>

          <li>I love dogs, reading, memes and gardening.</li>
