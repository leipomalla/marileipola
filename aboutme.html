      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        <br>
        Hi! <br> My name is Mari, it's so <span style="color: silver">nice to meet you!</span> <br>
        <br> I
        am a
        fresh web developer out of the oven and I'm looking for a job. My background is in healthcare
        sector.
        I have also studied Finnish language and communication science.
        I studied in Business College Helsinki to become a web
        developer. Studies were <span style="color: silver">brief but intense</span>: they
        started in March 2019 finished in December 2019.
        I was a real newbie when I started, but I learned a ton and
        beyond.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Since January 2020 I have been working as a web developer trainee on Finnish Net Solutions. I've worked with 
        database migrations and web developing with following stack: PHP (5.6 and 7.4), HTML, CSS, Javascript (and Jquery and Ajax).
        I've used Docker, git and SVN. CMS I have mostly developed is CakePHP4 but I've worked with Drupal8 too.

      <p>
        I am very curious to learn and enjoy <span style="color: silver">working hard.</span>
        I am trustworthy: in my latest job, I was assigned with a task
        of delivering transplants from abroad. I also worked as a
        senior nurse supporting colleagues with medical questions.
        I love dogs, reading, <span style="color: silver">memes</span> and gardening.
        I am <span style="color: silver">a fun person </span> and I take care of my co-workers.
