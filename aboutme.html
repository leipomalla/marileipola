        I am a public health nurse and a registered nurse.


        I have also studied Finnish language and communication science.


        My studies in Business College Helsinki to become a web
        developer have been brief but <span>intense</span>: they
        started in March 2019 and will finish in December 2019.


        I was a real newbie when I started, but I have learned a ton and
        beyond.

        My skill stack consists of basic knowledge of HTML5
        including CSS and JS, PHP and Java, React and Symfony.


        Currently I am more interested in backend than frontend.

        I have some knowledge of CMSs, such as Drupal.
        I use Git (mostly by myself though).

        I know Windows better than Linux but I am working on it.

        I enjoy working hard.

        I am trustworthy: in my latest job, I was assigned with a task
        of delivering transplants from abroad. I also worked as a
        senior nurse supporting colleagues with medical questions.


        I love dogs, reading, memes and gardening.
        I am a fun person and take care of my colleagues.
